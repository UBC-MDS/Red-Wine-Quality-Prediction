| Reviewer 1    | Tests: change tests path to `scripts` (they currently point to `src`, so don't work).               | Done. Also, ensured all tests ran properly, so we can run the command `pytest` in the root folder.                                                                                                |       [test 1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/pull/60/commits/30b44daf2dd72c0973bcc6bc6d12dfe573b7f17a), [test 2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/1be373ad016ed98dc8deb342279f4662c81c78c3), [test 3](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/8bb5cefbdc591df6018a7f961bf032af2583d63a), [test 4](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/a1d0b68b80cd8da6679a54de53a8dca6104b0192)    |
|              | Readability & Other: use `environment.yaml` in Dockerfile with use of `COPY` and `RUN`.              | While this enhances reusability in our work, we've given usage instructions for both the environment and Docker, so we've decided to keep both as is. This way users who choose the docker option can easily see the dependencies in the Dockerfile. |       n/a      |
| Reviewer 2    | Readability: report is a bit technical. Could take out mentions of software.                       | Created a software attribution section near the end of the report, instead of referencing it in the introduction, to facilitate a wider audience of readers.                                     |    [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/eb805c89c1614eff00e74a8926e9fcf91b474a95)         |
|               | Tests: include edge cases in test (i.e., correct data types, right number of rows in `data_split.py`, etc). | Made tests more robust.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       [test 1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/1be373ad016ed98dc8deb342279f4662c81c78c3),   [test 2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/39e7c86d2246579b9caa229c079fc7e527d3c155) |
|               | Other: move all scripts to `scripts` (no `src`).                                                   | Done to enhance the organization of our repository                                                                                                                                                      |        [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/388d6e6db799e4903fa7ba7cff188840ba9ffc06)   |  
| Reviewer 3    | Tests: typo in `test_set_deployment.py`.                                                            | Fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                              |        [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/1fa87ff247008832ac57442a24debd567c0ec56b )     |
|               | Other: try out log transformation to some features with pronounced skew.                            | Due to time restraints, this is not feasible for Milestone 4 but it is a useful idea and can be included in future work.                                                                            |   n/a          |
| Reviewer 4    | Community Guideline: `contributing.md` mentioned in `readme` but file doesn't exist.               | `CONTRIBUTING.md` added.                                                                                                                                                                           |      [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/b5e63f0bffb1ce0b101acd98124047f145bc3be9)       |
|               | Tests: tests available for some scripts but not all.                                                | Due to time constraints, cannot create new tests for the scripts from Milestone 3, but ensured previous tests are working and included error handling to make them more robust.                   |     *previously linked*        |
|               | Other: some scripts take positional arguments and some do not.                                      | This is okay for Milestone 4. But it's a good practice for consitency in scripts in future work. work.                                                                                                                                    |     n/a        |

| Functions & Test   | Some functions don't check for proper input and/or don't provide useful error messages. There are cases where the function is no different from the one function it calls. Error handlings are missing from 3/4 tests. | Fixed functions and tests as mentioned.                      |     [link 1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/6fb7f3a26cb91d6734755f8173577eac1168d5ef), [link 2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/deb064aa97e66e10e71da3047b2ba0eb3952a2bd)        |
| Reproducibility    | Suggested adding a few lines to enhance the README.md instructions for docker usage.                                           | Added.                                                      |     [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/934f5dac55a5b5456fcc07270685bf200b1f8995)        |

| Introduction      | Did not clearly identify and describe the dataset that was used to answer the question.             | Described the data in detail, including explicit column descriptions.                                                               |     [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/commit/e0c89e1b646c1bf17505e91e164478b25e8e8a55)        |
| Reproducibility   | Could not reproducibly run the analysis because one package was missing from the provided computational environment. | Updated environment (along with Dockerfile) to include Jupyter Notebook as a dependency.                                        |             |
