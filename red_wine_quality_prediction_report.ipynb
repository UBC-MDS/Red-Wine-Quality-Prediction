    "Red wines have a long history that can be traced all the way back to the ancient Greeks. Today, they are more accessible to an average person than ever, and yet despite its ubiquity, most people can barely tell the difference between a good and a bad wine, to the point where we need trained professionals (sommeliers) to understand the difference. In this project, we seek to use machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of the wine based on the physical and chemical properties of the liquid. The data set we will be using is taken from the UCI machine learning archive."
